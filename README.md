# Automated Job Application Handler
Hiring a suitable candidate for a role is a lengthy and cumbersome process. This automated job application handler will reduce the waiting time for candidates and selection time for recruitment teams. Features such as automatic refusal and automatic scoring by the engine based on the profile and business rules will speed up the hiring process. This system can be used as a guide to filter applicants and start the hiring process or it can be used side-by-side in the actual recruitment process. The only change is random score should be replaced by the interview score. The automatic feedback provided to the applicants according to their application makes the hiring process fair and saves hiring teamsâ€™ time. 

## Workflow
The workflow of the application handler is depicted by the following steps:
1) Applicants enter their information, select a job, send it to the recruiter and wait for the outcome.
2) The recruitment system stores the application and waits till the job deadline before proceeding to the screening stage.
3) The screener will reject those applications that do not meet the job requirements.
4) The applications passing the screening stage will be either fast-tracked or waitlisted by the recruiter based on other standards set by the recruitment team.
5) The interviewed candidates will be scored and compared.
6) The top-ranked candidate will then have to pass the threshold test, and the barrier is directly proportional to the number of valid applications received for the job.
5) Passing the barrier will result in the vacancy being fulfilled. If the job is fulfilled by one of the fast-tracked candidates, all waiting candidates will be notified of the outcome.
6) If fast-tracked candidates fail to fill up the role, waitlisted candidates will be called for an interview, and the process continues until the role is fulfilled or there are no more candidates on the waiting list.
7) Finally, all candidates, successful and unsuccessful, will be emailed about the application outcome.
